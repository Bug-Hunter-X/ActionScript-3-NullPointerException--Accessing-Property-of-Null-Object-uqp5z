# ActionScript 3 NullPointerException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: attempting to access a property of a null object. This can lead to a `NullPointerException` and unexpected application crashes.

The `bug.as` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version with a null check.  This highlights the importance of defensive programming in ActionScript 3, particularly when dealing with functions that may return null.
